This Project “Object counter using digital sensor and lcd using ATMEGA16 Microcontroller” is a reliable circuit that takes over the task of counting number of persons/visitors in the place where this is placed very accurately. For example, when somebody enters into the room then the counter is incremented by one and when any one leaves the room then the counter is decremented by one with the help of another object counter. The total number of persons inside the room is also displayed on the LCD displays. The microcontroller does the above job. It receives the signals from the sensors (Button), and this signal is operated under the control of software which is stored in ROM. Microcontroller ATMEGA16 continuously monitor the receives command, when any person pass through the sensor and presses a button then the received command by the user on the LCD are displayed, this is sensed by the Microcontroller.
